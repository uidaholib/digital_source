## Scanning and Preservation Procedures

Scans are performed and saved as non-compressed Tiffs.
Complete copies of our scans and metadata are stored in a geo-replicated dark archive drive, as well as external hard drive backups.
Variable scanning resolutions are described below.

### Manuscripts/Documents:
- 8 X 11 paper - 400 dpi
- Pieces of paper smaller than 5 x 7 are scanned at 600 dpi

### Photographs, Slides & Negatives:
- All photographs are scanned in color
- 8 x 10 and up scan at 400-600 dpi
- Images between 5 x 7 to 8 x 10 scan at 400-600 dpi
- 5 x 7 down to 3 x 5 scan at 600 dpi
- Smaller than 3 x 5 scan at 1200 dpi

### 3D objects:
- All 3D objects are photographed at 400-600 dpi
- When possible various sides of the object are photographed
- Photographs capture significant details on the object that add to its value

### Feed Scanner:
- Larger documents are scanned using our feed scanner
- Pages are scanned anywhere from 400 - 600 dpi

<h2 class="pt-4">Metadata Guidelines</h2>

Since we are using the CONTENTdm database access management system, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is the primary source of our metadata standards. Metadata for objects follows the needs of the collection. When ingested into CONTENTdm, those idiosyncratic standards are translated into Simple Dublin Core to enable the harvesting of that metadata into OCLC's WorldCat catalog and other aggregators.
