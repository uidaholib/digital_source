<h1 class="py-4">About CollectionBuilder</h1>

Most of our digital collections are generated using [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io), an open source minimal infrastructure platform developed by a team of librarians at the University of Idaho.

CollectionBuilder is driven by metadata and powered by static-web technology, so it's intuitive for librarians to use, lightweight, customizable, and secure. CollectionBuilder requires only a spreadsheet of metadata and a directory of digital objects to facilitate multiple modes of entry into a digital collection by generating timelines, maps, and browsing features that contextualize the collection's historic items. Following a Collections as Data model, CollectionBuilder also generates data files in multiple formats for researchers and patrons to download and explore.

Simple yet powerful, CollectionBuilder ensures that digital curation and preservation is in the hands of librarians. Read more about CollectionBuilder's minimal-computing approach at <https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>.
