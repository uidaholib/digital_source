<h1 class="py-4">About Our Space</h1>

The majority of the scanning and computer work that we do in Digital Initiatives is done in the Lau Center for Digital Scholarship, or Room 211, which is also known as the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) and the Digital Scholarship Lab. Regardless of what it's called, the room 211 is on the second floor of the library. 

Originally constructed as a space to support the research interests of the university -- David and Ann Lau donated funds in the 1990s to what was then the Lau Periodicals Service Center in honor of David's parents, Heber and Rhea -- the center was re-dedicated in April 2011 to acknowledge its function as the digital heart of the library.

In 2016, the library and CLASS received a Vandals Ideas Grant to revamp the space and add capacity for working with faculty from CLASS. New furniture and technology was introduced into the room, which now often houses classes and workshops in addition to the students and faculty that work on various projects in the space.
