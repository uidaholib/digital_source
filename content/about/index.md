## What We Do

The Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies department is responsible for digitizing materials from across the University of Idaho and making them publicly accessible as digital collections, hosted on our own CollectionBuilder platform. This process involves collaborating with student workers to digitize and transcribe material, ingest born digital material, build accurate metadata and design digital spaces specifically for the unique scholarly aspects of each collection. 

We also collaborate with departments, schools, librarians and our community to provide guidance on digital tools, projects and preservation and identify, launch and promote new collections.


## Our History

The department was established in 2008 with an initial charge to digitize and make accessible the library’s renowned International Jazz Collections. We currently maintain over a hundred digital collections and applications, and work that began in the lab has now been incorporated into a library department, Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies, with its own physical space, the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu).

## Our Space

The Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning is located on the second floor of the library building in room 211. The space was originally known as the Lau Periodicals Service Center in the 1990s, through generous donations by David and Ann Lau in honor of David’s parents, Heber and Rhea. The center was re-dedicated in April 2011 to acknowledge its new, digital focus.
